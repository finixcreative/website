		"p1": "I am excited to apply for Hampshire College’s new position of Chief Creative Officer. Hampshire is a beacon of progressive ideas, creativity, and intellectual freedom. The college’s incomparable opportunities attract students from all over the world, who represent a vast range of cultural norms and economic backgrounds. Building strong connections with that diverse and scattered audience poses unique marketing challenges, so Hampshire needs a dedicated and talented CCO to lead the way.",
		"p2": "I have a profound appreciation for Hampshire’s tradition of academic excellence, and I hold the motto “Non Satis Scire” close to heart. I graduated with my degree in “Graphic Design & Sign Making” in May 2009, but retained my passion for learning. Soon after, I expanded my horizons from “traditional” studio art and graphic design by adopting web code as my new paintbrush, and the internet as my new canvass. I gained valuable skills and experience at every stop in my career, excelling as a Production Artist, Marketing Consultant, Web Designer, UX Designer, Creative Director, and Co-founder of a creative collective. I have found success with companies of all sizes, across a range of industries, because great design is a universal language.",
		"p3": "I held several positions with Propel Marketing. I was one of the company’s early hires, starting out as a junior web designer within months of the company’s launch. I soon became a senior web designer as Propel quickly expanded into a bustling 200-employee marketing firm, and I worked as a UX designer alongside the software development team to create proprietary apps for internal use. I also led a cross-department effort to redesign key pieces of the corporate website. I was a leader among my peers, stepping up to provide quality assurance, and establishing training courses to educate Propel’s designers about new tools and best-practices.",
		"p4": "I am now the Creative Director of Associated Environmental Systems (AES), where I lead all marketing and web development efforts. When I joined AES, I inherited a small and undeveloped marketing operation. I set out to strengthen the AES brand and get ahead of our competitors in the market, and my efforts have led to revelatory advancements. I designed a completely new corporate website with a focus towards providing a seamless user experience and bolstering conversion rates. I led a team of developers to create a dashboard app that records data from AES devices - the first of it’s kind in the industry. The app was instrumental in landing a large hardware contract with Apple. I also led successful marketing campaigns targeting high-profile clients including Apple, Boeing, DuPont, General Electric, General Motors, Gillette, Google, Hewlett Packard, Intel, Lockheed Martin, NASA, Nest, Procter & Gamble, and the U.S. Army, among others.",
		"p5": "I have a bright vision for Hampshire’s future, and as Chief Creative Officer I would work tirelessly to turn that vision into reality. I want to build up the college’s reputation, develop a strong brand, leverage technology to share our message with new audiences around the world, and usher in a vibrant new class of students. I am eager to support the educational community that empowered me to explore my creativity and learn “outside the box”. I would be honored to help the next generation of activists, artists, inventors, farmers, filmmakers, performers, scientists, and writers to find opportunities that match their passions, and guide their first steps on a lifelong journey.",
